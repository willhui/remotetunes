RemoteTunes
======================================

MCE IR remote controls offer control over Windows Media Player and
Windows Media Center. But if you use iTunes, you are left in the dark.
The IR remote control will only work while iTunes is the foreground
window, which hampers its utility.

With RemoteTunes, you can leverage your MCE remote control's media
buttons (play, pause, stop, previous track, next track) to control
iTunes regardless of what application is the foreground window.

RemoteTunes comes in two flavors: 32-bit and 64-bit. You must run BOTH
flavors together if you are on Windows x64. If you are using Win32,
then you only need to download and run the 32-bit version.

RemoteTunes is based on the same codebase used for Grapple, so it is
fairly compact and unintrusive.
